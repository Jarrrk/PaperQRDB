# PaperQRDB
Fed up of uncontrollable, resource heavy databases? Get rid of the hassle of databases and switch to PaperQRDB! The true flat-file storage method!

*what is this?*

PaperQRDB was a PHP script which would export MySQL table data per row into JSON format which is then stored in QR Codes that could be printed on paper, *formatted with the table name at the top of the page!*

I was going to upload the silly script into GitHub but lost the code, the idea itself was mocking modern business practices which were insistive on ignoring technical departments and persuing '*cost effective*' (free) methods to solve problems.
